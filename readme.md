# About Cards for Community

For now, this isn't a game. These cards, plus our introductory _intro to open data_, help you learn three things: 
 - how to sort, filter, group by, and roll-up data
 - how to use NYC's open data portal and/or basic spreadsheet functions
 - core NYC 311 service request data atributes
 
If you are using these cards for the first time, we highly recommend that you read our [Cards for Community Lab](http://bit.ly/opendata_offline) and review our [companion slides](http://bit.ly/2iotbQ9 ). (Note - Eventually, we'll migrate all of these files to GitHub. If you want to help us, please visit our project issues and help out.)

# How to play

There are four types of cards: Action cards, Column cards, Data Value cards, and Story cards. 

The goal is to sequence action, column, and data value cards to answer the story card. If you want to enrich the playing experience, you should either explore the [sample data via a spreadsheet]9https://github.com/BetaNYC/cards-for-community/tree/master/sample%20data application or use the [NYC 311 open data dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/data). Playing the these will teach you about data analysis, specific analytical functions, and NYC's government.

1. Sort cards into piles: Action, Column Name, Data Value and Story. 
1. Choose a Story card.
1. From the middle section of the Story card, select the required Data Actions (in Blue) and Data Columns (in Orange) that you’ll need to build your answer.
1. Now is the time to customize your story. Choose Data Value cards to match the Columns in a way that tells YOUR story, or if you can’t find the value you are looking for, take a blank Data Value card, and write it in.
1. Lay out your cards in a way that helps you tell the story.
1. Read your story out loud (refer to the bottom section of the card for cues).
1. Now, once you are familiar with the NYC Open Data portal, you can plug in the necessary steps to determine an accurate, up-to-date answer.
